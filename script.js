/* EXERCISE 14: LAYING OUT CARDS

To this point, we've worked with a lot of figures in our HTML. Figures are great where the image is the focus of the story, and the text describes the image.

However, not all images with text may need the <figure> element. Here, we have a series of images from certain artists. The cards should link to a page with more information (links provided). 

PART 1: What is the right markup for these cards?

PART 2: How do we lay these cards out to look a specific way on mobile and desktop layouts?
